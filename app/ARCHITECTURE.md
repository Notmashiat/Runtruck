# RunTruck: how it is built, and how to fix it

Read this first when something is broken or you are about to add a feature.
`README.md` lists every folder and screen; this file explains the rules the
code follows and where to look.

## The stack (kept small on purpose)

| What | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| TypeScript (strict) | All application code. No plain JavaScript in `src/`. |
| React 19 + React Router 7 | Screens and URLs. |
| CSS (plain, `ui-*` classes in `src/styles/shell.css`) | All styling. No CSS framework. |
| Vite 8 | Dev server and production build. |
| Vitest + Testing Library | Tests. |
| oxlint | Lint. |

Runtime dependencies are `react`, `react-dom` and `react-router-dom`, and
nothing else. PDF, Excel, Word, ZIP and CSV files are written by small modules
in `src/lib/` rather than by libraries. Think twice before adding a dependency:
each one is code nobody here has read, and it has to be kept up to date for years.

## Commands

Run these inside `app/`.

```
npm run dev        # dev server on http://localhost:5173
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript only
npm test           # all tests, once
npm run test:watch # tests, re-run on save
npm run lint       # oxlint
npm run verify     # typecheck + tests + production build (what Vercel and CI run)
```

A deploy is refused when `npm run verify` fails, so a type error or a failing
test never reaches production.

## Where things live

```
src/
  main.tsx        start-up: error handlers, saved settings, the root error boundary
  App.tsx         every route; each page is loaded on demand (lib/lazyPage.ts)
  pages/          one file per screen or tab
  components/     dialogs, the shell (Sidebar, Header, AppLayout) and shared pieces
  context/        AppShellContext: the company's records and every save/delete
  data/           record types and the business rules (pure functions, tested)
  lib/            storage, errors, auth, ids, dates, exports, PDF: no screens
  styles/         CSS
  test/           test set-up
```

Rule of thumb: **rules go in `data/` or `lib/` as plain functions; screens only
show things and call them.** A calculation written inside a component cannot
be tested and gets copied; one in `data/` can be tested and is written once.

## How data flows

```
screen ──calls──▶ AppShellContext (saveLoad, saveInvoice, …)
                        │  usePersisted (lib/persist.ts)
                        ▼
                  lib/storage.ts ──▶ localStorage  runtruck-<companyId>-<records>
                  lib/fileStore.ts ─▶ IndexedDB    attached files
```

- **Multi-tenant keys.** Every company's records are stored under
  `runtruck-<companyId>-…` (`scopedKey` in `lib/account.ts`). Never read or
  write `localStorage` directly: go through `lib/storage.ts`, which reports
  failed saves and keeps open tabs in step.
- **Reading saved data.** Each record list has a reviver in
  `AppShellContext.tsx`. A record that does not fit is repaired or moved to
  `runtruck-<companyId>-quarantine`; one bad record never empties a list.
- **Ids are never reused** (`lib/ids.ts`), even after a record is deleted.
- **Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings.** Do date arithmetic only with
  `lib/isoDates.ts`; it never throws on a blank or mistyped date. "Today" is
  `todayIso()` from `lib/clock.ts` (the company's time zone).
- **Money** is rounded with `round2` (`data/invoicing.ts`).

### There is no server yet

Everything above lives in the browser. That is the one real limit of the
current build: records are per browser (about 5 MB per site), accounts are
checked in the browser, and two people do not see each other's work. Before
client companies use RunTruck for real it needs a server: a database, sign-in
checked on the server, and an API.

The code is arranged so that change is contained:

- `lib/storage.ts` and `lib/persist.ts` are the only places that read and
  write records. Replace their insides with API calls and the screens do not change.
- `lib/auth.ts` is the only place that checks a password.
- `setErrorSink()` in `lib/errorLog.ts` is where error reports can be sent to
  a server or a service such as Sentry.

## When something breaks

A crash never takes the whole app down. `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` wraps
the app, the sidebar, the header, each page, each tab and each dialog, so a
fault shows a "Something went wrong here" panel in that one place and the rest
keeps working.

Every fault is recorded by `lib/errorLog.ts` with a reference like
`ERR-K3F9Q2`, the screen it happened on, the release and build running, and
the stack trace.

To find a problem a user reports:

1. Ask for the reference on the panel (or have them press **Copy details**).
2. Open **Developer › Error log** on that device. Each entry shows the
   message, where it happened, how many times, and the stack.
3. The stack names the real function ("at PayrollTab"): production builds keep
   function names. Source maps are not published (they would give away the
   source code). For exact lines, check out the commit shown as the entry's
   Build, run `npm run build`, and open the matching file in `app/maps/`.
4. Write a test that reproduces it in the matching `*.test.ts`, fix it, and
   run `npm run verify`.

Other signs worth knowing:

- **"Could not save" banner**: the browser's storage is full or blocked
  (`lib/storage.ts`). Nothing typed after the banner appeared is saved.
- **A list looks short**: check `runtruck-<companyId>-quarantine` in the
  browser's storage for records that could not be read.
- **Blank page after a deploy**: an old tab asked for a file from the previous
  build. `lib/lazyPage.ts` reloads once by itself.

## Releasing a feature

Every new or changed client-facing feature goes behind a release
(`data/releases.ts`) and is checked with `isLive('<change id>')`, keeping the
old behaviour otherwise. Super admins deploy a release to companies from
**Developer › Releases**. Fixes for bugs and reliability are not gated.

## Adding a feature: the checklist

1. Types and rules in `data/<thing>.ts`, with tests next to it.
2. State and save/delete in `AppShellContext.tsx` through `usePersisted`, with
   a reviver, and `noteIds` for its ids.
3. The screen in `pages/`, registered in `App.tsx` with `page(...)`.
4. Forms through `RecordDialog`; attach buttons open `AttachDialog`.
5. Long tables use `usePaged` (`lib/paging.tsx`); sorting and filters come
   from `lib/tableTools.tsx`.
6. Put it behind `isLive(...)` and add the change to `data/releases.ts`.
7. `npm run verify`.

## Security notes

- Attached files open in a tab only when they are a PDF or a picture; anything
  else is downloaded (`lib/attachments.ts`), because an HTML or SVG file opened
  on this site could run a script with the company's records.
- CSV exports neutralise cells that a spreadsheet would run as a formula (`lib/csv.ts`).
- `vercel.json` sends a Content-Security-Policy: scripts only from this site,
  no inline scripts. Keep it that way (`public/theme-init.js` exists for that reason).
- A free trial that has ended locks the company's accounts out (`trialEnded`
  in `data/companies.ts`, enforced in `lib/auth.ts`); nothing is deleted.
- Deleting a company removes its records and files from the browser
  (`purgeCompanyData` in `lib/companyStore.ts`).
- Passwords are salted and hashed (`lib/password.ts`), but they are checked in
  the browser. That is not real security until sign-in moves to a server.
