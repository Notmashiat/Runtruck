// RunTruck's releases: what each version adds or changes. Super admins
// (Company ID 1) always run the newest code, so they can try it first; a
// client company only gets a release once a super admin deploys it in
// Developer › Releases.
//
// How to ship a change:
// 1. Add it to a release below (a new release at the end of the list, or
//    the newest one if that is not deployed yet), with a unique change id.
// 2. In the code, show the new or changed behaviour only where
//    isLive('<change id>') is true (lib/releases.ts), and keep the old
//    behaviour otherwise, so companies that have not received the release
//    keep working exactly as before.
// 3. Once it is deployed to every company, the check can be removed in a
//    later clean-up (the entry stays here as history).
